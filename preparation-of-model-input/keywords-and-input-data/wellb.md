# WELLB

**WELLB**         provides data for wellbore simulation using drift model.

Record **WELLB.1**

&#x20;                       Free format for 7 parameters

&#x20;                        solidFrac, MaxC0, ku, WellFrac, Epson, sg1, bhExchange  (Apply to all well sections)

_SolidFrac_         Solid fraction (only used if one wants to increase thermal stability of wellbore cells by including a skin of rock around wellbore or a core of solid inside an annular tunnel in calculation of energy balance but not invoke the usage of the x material). This solid fraction would not affect anything else (e.g., the volume of wellbore cell in fluid flow calculation).

_MaxC0_           the maximum value of the profile parameter (Cmax).

_ku_                    critical Kutateladze number.

_WellFrac_        wellbore fraction in the model grid (default is 1.0,  must be <=1.0).

_Epson_             roughness parameter of the well wall.

_Sg1_                  parameter.

_btExch_           borehole heat exchange with surrounding rocks, TRUE or FALSE. If it is TRUE, the input of HeatExch  (see WELLB.2.1) for all well sections will be neglected.  &#x20;

Record **WELLB.2.1** （optional)

&#x20;                        Free format for multiple parameters

&#x20;                        ActionWord, para\_1, ......, para\_n

_ActionWord   a_ string which can be a rock name, "GEOTH", "REGFX", "OFFMA", or "FREEE".

**(1)**    If _ActionWord_ is a rock name, parameters for specific well section defined by this rock will be inputted. The parameters (all optional) are:&#x20;

&#x20;                        RockNam&#x65;_,_ roughness, perforationF, CSArea, surFMulti, outdiam, perimeter, HeatExch   &#x20;

_RockName_    the rock name for a well section to which the following 7 parameters will be applied to. The rock must be defined in the keyword "[ROCKS](rocks.md)" for a well section.&#x20;

_perforationF_   perforation (screen) fraction at this well section.

_CSArea_             cross-section area at this well section.

&#x20;_surFMulti_         multipler for side surface area describing nozal effect for "x" type well at this section.

_outdiam_            if >0.0 indicating this rock represents a wellbore annulus section; the _outdiam_ value is the outside diameter of the annulus section.

_perimeter_          User-specified perimeter of the pipe, used to account for the additional pressure loss due to complicated geometry (e.g., elbow, joint, and other non-straight pipe) by assigning a larger value. If omitted, the default perimeter (calculated based on the grid) will be used.&#x20;

_HeatExch_         if _HeatExch_>0.0, the heat exchange between the well and surrounding rocks at this wellbore section will be turn on. If  _HeatExch<=_&#x30;.0, it will be turn off (default).&#x20;

**(2)**    If  _ActionWord_ is "**GEOTH**", parameters for calculation of the initial temperatures in the model domain will be inputted.   The parameters are:&#x20;

&#x20;                          GEOTH, GrToAll, ref\_temp, ref\_elev1, T\_grad1 , ref\_elev2, T\_grad2, ......&#x20;

_GrToAll_              indicator for geothermal gradients applying range, =0 apply to well elements only, >0 apply to all model elements.

_ref\_temp_          reference temperature at the elevation ref\_elev1.

_ref\_elev1_           the lowest reference elevation level.

_T\_grad1_             temperature gradient at the elevation ref\_elev1

_ref\_elev2_           the second reference elevation level.

_T\_grad2_             temperature gradient at the elevation ref\_elev2

As many as 4 reference elevations and temperature gradients can be inputted.

**(3)**    If  _ActionWord_ is "**REGFX**", parameters for assigning known mass flow rate to a well face will be inputted.  The parameters are:&#x20;

&#x20;                          REGFX, FaceName, iniTarget, TransTime, endTarget, maxTarget, Nsteps

_FaceName_       the name of a well face that the mass flow rate will apply to. It must be identical to the connection name of two elements in the wellbore.&#x20;

_iniTarget_          the mass flow rate at time 0, a negative value indicates flow from Cell 1 to Cell 2 (kg/s).

_TransTime_      end time of flow rate transition period (s).

_maxTarget_      total mass flow rate at the end of transition period (kg/s).

_endTarget_      total mass flow rate for the time after transition period (kg/s).

_Nsteps_               number of tabular flow rate

If Nsteps>0, additonal Nsteps data records are required.

&#x20;                          OFFMA, connection1, connection2, ...... , connection10

_connectionN_   connection name of two wellbore elements.    it  must be one of the connections defined in the "CONNE" data section in MESH file.     &#x20;

**(5)**    If  _ActionWord_ is "**FREEE**",  input of a list of free-end well elements whose density or saturation does not count for spatial average. The maximum number of elements for the list is 10.&#x20;

&#x20;                          FREEE, element1, element2, ...... , element10
