# Enhanced Coal Bed Methane

Simulation of enhanced coal bed methane (ECBM) was implemented in the TOUGH4 based on TOUGH2/EOS7C-ECBM by Webb (2011).&#x20;

In ECBM, CO2 is pumped into methane-rich coal beds. Due to adsorption processes, the CO2 is sorbed onto the coal, which displaces previously sorbed methane (CH4). The released methane can then be recovered, at least partially offsetting the cost of CO2 sequestration. In order to perform simulations for such a processes. The extended Langmuir model is used for the prediction. The extended Langmuir isotherm is given below (Law et al., 2002).&#x20;The gas storage capacity for a single gas species is given by the Langmuir relationship:
