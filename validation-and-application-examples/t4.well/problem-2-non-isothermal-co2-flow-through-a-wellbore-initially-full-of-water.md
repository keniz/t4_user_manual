# Problem 2-Non-isothermal CO2 flow through a wellbore initially full of water

This problem is a case of two-phase flow up an open well bore. The scenario envisioned is the tip of a migrating CO2 plume at 10% gas saturation encountering an open well initially filled with water. The focus here is on flow in the wellbore. The reservoir is assumed to be able to maintain the constant pressure, temperature, and gas saturation during the process. Starting from hydrostatic conditions and a geothermal temperature gradient in the well, an overpressure of 0.1 MPa (1 bar) is applied to the reservoir to mimic an injection-induced overpressure. Wellbore heat transmission to the formation is calculated with the analytical solution. Figure 3 shows part of the input file for Case 2 (with brine in reservoir).
