# Problem7-NAPL Spill in the Unsaturated Zone (r2dl)

This simulation demonstrates the application of TMVOC to a flow problem with realistic features as would be encountered in actual field situations. We consider a multicomponent NAPL spill in the unsaturated zone that is followed by redistribution of the NAPL plume within the unsaturated zone and along the water table. Subsequent remediation operations involve VOC recovery from the unsaturated zone by soil vapor extraction close to the spill area and NAPL extraction by pumping from the saturated zone. We include a discussion of the approach for preparing initial and boundary conditions, including atmospheric conditions at the land surface, recharge across the vadose zone due to infiltration at the land surface, and natural flow in the unconfined aquifer.
